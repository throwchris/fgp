    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Hebrews 3:1-19</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, 
        consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</strong> You see now, he is speaking to us.  Isn't that beautiful that he calls us this way, holy 
        brethren partakers of the heavenly calling?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house. For 
        this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses,</strong> Speaking of Jesus.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more 
        honour than the house. For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</strong> So he gets the greatest honour, doesn't he?
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</strong> In 
        this generation.  God caused him.  You see, all Scripture is given for our learning and for our admonition.  So Moses had to go just like he had to go.  God commanded it, in 
        order that we might read it and know where we are and who we are.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold 
        fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</strong> There's no guarantee, is there now?  You see there is no guarantee that we are going to make 
        it. It is up to us.  We are not locked in there to where we can't get out, but we have to believe it.  We have to believe the Word.  We have to walk.  We have to be 
        obedient.  We have to stay free from sin.  If we do sin, then we have to go to the Lord.  Amen.  Any of you believe that what we were teaching, that that gave the excuse for 
        anything?  Did you believe that you couldn't come out of Life, that you couldn't die?  Sin brings death.  Remember that.  Sin still brings death.  And because you have Life 
        working in you doesn't mean that you can't sin and die.  It is to him that overcometh shall inherit all things</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.22</p>    



    <p class="w3-justify w3-xlarge">The Sons Walk In Obedience</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Now I am thankful that we have Life in us, and the Bible says so.  We must believe it and I do believe it.  And I know that I have, because Christ had 
        spoken, as I have said many times, he says, "You live because I live."  Christ's Life was keeping me alive.  I'm not living any more after the flesh but after the life of 
        Christ, as long as I walk in obedience.  But if I didn't walk in obedience, then he'd kick me out the door like anybody else.  So I must walk in obedience. Sin will still 
        bring death.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if 
        ye will hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</strong> When the children of Israel walked in the 
        wilderness.  Don't harden your hearts as they did.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. Wherefore I was 
        grieved with that generation</strong> God says.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. So I sware in 
        my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</strong> There was no need for them trying.  God said they will not.  They have been too disobedient.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Take heed,</strong> He's preaching and he says<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an 
        evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</strong> Or forsaking.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To 
        day;</strong> Time is going to be no more pretty soon when you don't count time.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of 
        sin. For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our Faith or confidence stedfast unto the end;</strong> I'm so glad that he puts that in there that we 
        don't get careless.  We could get careless and say, "We have life," which we have.  We could get careless and cast it away.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> While it is 
        said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by 
        Moses. But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? And to whom sware he that they should not enter 
        into his rest, but to them that believed not? So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</strong> Think of it.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.23</p>    


    <p class="w3-justify">Provocation is during that time of the walk when they were being tested in the wilderness.  It's the time of testing, like we are going through now, our 
        time of testing.  Amen.  Or trial.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Hebrews 4:1-3</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into 
        his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed 
        with faith in them that heard it. For we which have believed do enter into rest,</strong> Do you believe you have life?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> as he said, As I 
        have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished</strong> Here it is again.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> from the foundation 
        of the world.</strong> Everything was finished from the foundation. It wasn't built when it just had a foundation. Amen. That was before the world was built.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Hebrews 4:6-10</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
    </strong> They must.  Some must enter into this life.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: Again, he 
    limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time;</strong> Way out there David, from your time.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> as it is said,
    </strong> That reaches us.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> To day</strong> Now this day.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> if ye will hear his voice, harden not your 
    hearts.</strong> Speaking to us because we are the ones that are receiving the revelation.  He is speaking to us.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For if Jesus had given 
    them rest,</strong> See, he's giving them the Old Testament.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. There remaineth therefore 
    a rest to the people of God.</strong> Now this was spoken nineteen hundred years ago and then some.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For he that is entered into his rest, Like 
    God did into his. he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</strong> We have to cease from our own works, thinking us do-gooders have any reward coming, but 
    only through Christ.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.24</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Hebrews 4:14-16</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into 
    the heavens,</strong> Into the Spirit, become a Spirit being.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</strong> We must confess 
    our faith.  Do not be as the children of Israel were with Moses.  Life was preached back then.  Absolutely. There are many scriptures about that, that it was preached.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Numbers 16:5</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he spake unto Korah</strong> Now all of you know about Korah and 
    his rebellion, coming against Moses and Aaron and so on and so forth.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the Lord will shew who 
    are his,</strong> And that is what I wanted to encourage you with.  The Lord will show.  We will know.  There is going to be a separating the sheep from the goats, and God will 
    show who you are.  Like he said, tomorrow God will show who are his.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and who is holy;</strong> He is going to show who is holy and who is not 
    holy.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and will cause him to come near unto him:</strong> Unto God.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> even him whom he hath chosen will he 
    cause to come near unto him.</strong> And we are the chosen again.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.25</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Psalm 82:6-8</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> I have said,</strong> God said.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Ye 
    are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</strong> Was man created in his likeness and his image?  Are we sons?  God looks on us as gods, part of him.  You see we 
    know that there is only one true God.  Do you understand what I am saying, now?  But he looks on us as gods.  His Word says so in several places, because we are gods, like Father 
    like son, amen, if we are walking in righteousness and holiness.  Your name is Jones or Pete or whoever, well then, you carry that same name, amen.  That is his name.  
    Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</strong> Even though they have the Holy Ghost, even though they are 
    called, many will die like a man instead of living.  They will just lay down and die, like man died.  And then he says<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Arise, O 
    God,</strong> Speaking to the people.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</strong> You see he is speaking one 
    sentence.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But ye shall die like men, and fall</strong> Now after he just got through calling them gods<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> . I 
    have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</strong> These that he is calling gods.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But ye shall die like 
    men,</strong> Even though you are gods.  You have the life of God living in you.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 
    Arise, O God, judge the earth:</strong> Go ahead, judge the earth he says.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for thou shalt inherit all nations.</strong> God's great plan was 
    complete from the beginning and is unfolding in his perfect timing.  Remember there is not one thing out of place.  Every word shall come to pass.  We can be as the children of 
    Israel or walk on into the fullness of the kingdom.  And how do we do it?</p>
           
  

    <p class="w3-justify w3-xlarge">By the Word and by the Spirit</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.26</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">As we are led by the Spirit, but especially this Word we have to know.  You'll never know revelation of the Word until you get into it and read it.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify w3-xlarge">The Sons Know The Word, His Word</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">You'll receive some revelation from each other as we go.  But you have to receive this revelation for yourself as you study.  And I want to tell you as 
        sure as I am sitting here, if you don't study the Word of God and know it, you will not come into the kingdom. You will not.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Because the Spirit, the Holy Ghost himself, as you study the Word, has to implant it in your spirit.  Then it becomes a part of you and you grow. I have to 
        warn you of this.  And don't read it like you are reading a newspaper, bu-la, bu-la, bu-la, bu-la, bu-la.  You'd get what you'd get, a jumble, a mess.  But if you sit down 
        and search the Scriptures, search the Scriptures, and don't be proud because you read ten chapters.  The thing is, you probably got nothing out of it.  Take one word at a 
        time and see what it means and what he is saying.  To search him, search.  If you lost your diamond ring or your diamond out of your ring even, you would search your house 
        looking for it.  He said it is a hidden treasure that they went and bought the whole field to find it, Jesus.  Do you remember the scriptures?</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.27</p>    


    <p class="w3-justify">See there was a treasure, a hidden treasure and he bought the whole field to go in there and dig and labor; finally dug up the whole field hunting for that 
        treasure.  And it is the same with us.  This is a hidden treasure; the Bible is full of hidden treasure.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">You'll never learn it from somebody else.  You never will.  You will get some understanding, but I must warn you, it only comes as you draw close to God 
        yourself and as you search the Scriptures and learn it by revelation as the Holy Ghost within you will bring you into all truth.  He said he lives and abides in here and he 
        is truth.  He will bring you into all truth. There is no other way.  There is no other way.  There is no easy way.  You wait on God in the presence of God in quietness 
        alone.  That is the way you receive.  Now it is all right to read back and forth if you want, in the Scriptures, but there has to be times when you have to get alone and you 
        have to wait on God and you have to wait until he gets ready.  He'll give it to you when it is his time, not your time.  Just remember that.  "Oh, I spent ten minutes; that 
        is enough for today."  Is it?  You have to do it when he says so.  When he will not give revelation until he gets ready, and he knows when you have searched for him.  He 
        says when you have searched for me, you will find me.  Didn't he?  And this is where we find him, right through the book.  Right here.  Right through the book.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">I can guarantee you, you will not find him just sitting listening to teaching. You will not. You will not ever have that Life develop in you. You must get 
        alone with God and let him talk to you. Let him reveal to you.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Then it becomes a part of you and you'll grow and understand. How do you think God gave me this revelation even today?  I am not boasting, do you 
        understand?  I don't read as much as I ought to.  And I am pretty careless lately, not studying enough.  But it just seems like I've read it so much, that it just seems like 
        you know all there is to know almost at times, until I get in the simple scriptures and find out I don't even know what they mean.  Then I know I haven't studied enough.  
        Amen.  And you know, I am not boasting, but I say, after 40 years I should have learned something at least about the two births.  But I didn't know that, because God gives 
        it in his timing.  We had to know that today, what it is, that the second birth is the LIFE given us by the Spirit.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Amen, so God bless you. Okay, I just thank God for his word.  This evangelist, I don't know a thing about him.  We will see how much you know the Word.  
        I don't have any idea what he is going to teach or preach or what.  And it doesn't worry me either.</p>
