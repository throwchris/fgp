  <p class="w3-justify">This was a greater understanding because I looked up to see and it shocked me what I found in the dictionary.</p>

<p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">John 10:25-30</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Jesus answered them,</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> I told you, 
  and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. My sheep hear my 
  voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</strong> All right, 
  I looked up the word “perish,” just for fun, and here is the exact quotation from the dictionary.  “Perish” means to suffer a violent death or an untimely death or to pass from 
  existence.  Now that is what the dictionary says.  That is what “perish” means.<strong class="w3-text-red"> And I give unto them eternal life;</strong> You have (Gene, for you or 
  any of us but especially to Gene tonight: I want Gene to see this.)  …you have the Life, the eternal life, living in you and working in you.  So, really, there is nothing that can 
  kill you if you can just get a hold of this.  And I am not saying it in a condemning way because it takes the faith of God, of Jesus Christ.  But you do have that Life.  You are 
  called: the words that God has spoken over you about the kingdom.  You are called a kingdom man.  There is no question.  It is in the Spirit.  He brought you in at this time to 
  have a part in his kingdom.  And you have that kingdom Life working in you.  What you need to do, if you can get a hold of it, is to just rejoice in your home, everywhere.</p>
    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Nothing can happen to us no matter what.<strong class="w3-text-red"> My Father, which gave them me,</strong> Or gave them to me.
      <strong class="w3-text-red"> is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one.</strong> Nobody, nothing can take you out 
      of that Life, out of that Life that he gives us, amen.  There is nothing that can do it.  There is nothing.  We can make our own choice.  It is absolutely up to us.  We have 
      to make that choice.  I hate to bring myself into it, but I have faced death so many times, and at other times besides the heart attacks, and I have had to just say, “Oh come 
      on, now, I know because God spoke this or because God spoke that.”  I didn't teach the Life message then, but I knew that I couldn't die until all of these things were 
      fulfilled.  And God has spoken things over you, and that has to be fulfilled because it is the word of Life spoken.  And if you have a word concerning your future, just hang 
      on.  He'll try your faith.  You bet he'll try your faith.  He sure will, until you just almost wear out.  But you just have to hang on.  Amen.  But he will fulfill every word 
      he has spoken.</p> 
      
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.6</p>  
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Man, I could go home and bring stuff that I could talk about for three hours on prophecy, just prophecy that God has brought to pass.  And there is not one 
      word prophesied – you know here's what tickles me - I get so excited about him because he is so sweet.  You know he'll cause a jackass to give a prophecy and it will be true.  
      Amen.  Didn't he?  You don't have to be somebody to prophesy.  He'll just use anything he wants to prophesy with.  And I have had guys that were so full of sin and so putrid 
      come up, preachers, and I knew they were rotten stinkers, but yet the word of God, he caused them to prophesy truth over me regardless.</p>



    
    <p class="w3-justify">You don't have to be somebody – the least are the ones I like to hear from because God gets control of them because they are so scared. You've heard me 
      say that before.  But I don't want anybody that is so fluent and all so educated in prophetic word. I don't want that.  I'd rather have one of you kids – when God moves on 
      you – rather than anything else because God honors that. And it always comes back to me that God can cause a jackass to speak, so let these kids prophesy, these little ones.  
      I'll accept it. Amen. I wasn't talking about you big kids, I was talking about these little children. All these little children, they can prophesy. Amen.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now I just today understood what the Lord was talking about after reading this scripture for forty years.  I really understand, I believe, now, what the 
      Lord is saying, in fact, I know that it is.  Because I have had so many questions, so many from so many people, on this scripture.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">John 3:3</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Jesus answered and said unto him,</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> 
      Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</strong> Now we are going to prove something here pretty soon.  I don't know if I 
      will let the scripture do it, maybe we will talk a little; maybe that will help you to understand.  I really want you to get this because it means something.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.7</p>  
  

    <p class="w3-justify w3-xxlarge">Salvation:  The First Birth</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">Now if someone had – before Christ came into your life with salvation, just with salvation – if someone would have talked to you about even salvation, you 
      couldn't understand it.  Do you see what I am saying?  Except Christ come into your life, that first step, you couldn't see anything.  This is the rebirth.  This is the being 
      born again.  But there is another birth.  There are two births, and we will get to that.  But I know I was in darkness and in sin, and I couldn't believe that God would 
      forgive me for sin and all of this and that.  And then it burst like a light and I understood, and the Spirit moved and I knew I was saved.  Somehow, I knew I was forgiven.  
      Well, that is when you start to see the kingdom.  Now when he says,<strong class="w3-text-red"> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again he cannot see the 
      kingdom of God,</strong> you cannot see anything about God.  You just can't see.  Oh, you could pound them over the head with a baseball bat and tell them, “Can't you see?  
      Can't you see?”  “No, I can't see,” because the enlightenment comes from within.  Amen.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify w3-xxlarge">The Sons Experience The Second Birth</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">We are going to read verses 5 through 8.  Now listen carefully, because we need to get this straightened out.  This is the first time that I really got 
      straightened out about it.  I had a lot of questions about this thing.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">John 3:5-8</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Jesus answered,</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Verily, verily, 
      I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</strong> Now you see, I taught that that was the natural birth 
      because we are born with water, but it is not so.  The Lord showed me different today.<strong class="w3-text-red"> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is 
      born of the Spirit is spirit.</strong> We are also a flesh being; we are also a spirit being.  Aren't we?  So just hang on here so we see this.<strong class="w3-text-red"> 
        Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it 
        cometh,</strong> Now he is talking about the Spirit, not accepting your salvation.<strong class="w3-text-red"> and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the 
          Spirit.</strong> Now this is a literal thing.  I am not going to get into this again tonight about the sign of being here and there and everywhere by the Spirit, appearing 
          and disappearing.  But the Spirit being, in God's fulfilling of his time, is like the wind.  This is one of the things the Lord is showing.  This is what he is saying 
          here, but it wasn't time for that revelation.  It is time for that revelation now.  We are moving on.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.8</p>     

    <p class="w3-justify">It is time for us to know that some of us are going to be so pure we are going to be like the wind.  Do you see, and here and there and everywhere.  
      So is everyone that is born of the Spirit.  Now there is a birth that we have entered into.  Let's see what God had shown me here.  I have it written down. If we are just born 
      again or receive Christ's forgiveness and not born of the Spirit, we are still under the curse of death. Just to be just saved, you are under the curse of death.  But when you 
      receive the Spirit, the Holy Ghost, then you are born into Life.  That is, the Spirit of Christ.  He said,<strong class="w3-text-red"> “Except I go away, the Spirit cannot 
      come.”</strong> So the Holy Ghost is really the Spirit of Christ.  But still under the curse of death after the flesh.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">If we believe and obey the Spirit of truth, if we believe it and receive it, we are freed from the curse, which is death. So there are the two births, and 
      we will go on to prove it in the Scriptures.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">John 3:36</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life:</strong> You already 
      have it.  You don't have to die to get it.  You already have it.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life;</strong> Now you see, the 
      Son came in the form of the Holy Ghost in us.  Do you see it, how plain it is?  You see, you don't have Christ living in you when you are forgiven for your sin.  Do you get 
      it?  Do you see what I am saying?  I want you to get it.  If not, we will go over it.  We will stop here, because this is the whole thing to the life message.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.9</p>  
    

    <p class="w3-justify">You have to have the Holy Ghost, which is Christ when he comes to set up his abode within, and I think all of us have the Holy Ghost.  The first is just 
      the forgiveness of sin, then you go by the way of death.  They can't understand it.  They can't enter into it because they don't have the Spirit of Life.  They have just been 
      forgiven for their sin.  Now it is very plain.  It is to me, because God just really hammered on me until I actually know what he is saying.  I know that there is no question. 
      Just as much as I know that I have Life, I know that this is truth now.  And I have never heard this taught, but I know it is the truth.  I know the difference between the 
      Spirit – and it will tell it because I have more scriptures here.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the 
      Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</strong> Now it doesn't mean that he will go to hell, but the wrath of his flesh.  This was the judgment of God.  
      The judgment of God is death.  So that wrath abides on him.  Now that is the way it is.  We can't change it.  I don't know why God has it that way.  It is none of my 
      business.  I just know it is the truth.  And I know that is what these scriptures say. </p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Because the curse was still on the flesh until they received the baptism, until Christ went away and the Holy Ghost had to come. Then comes Life with it.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">From that time forth they could have come in.  Only God has a perfect plan, a perfect time for all things and this is the time for Life.  Isn't it fun?  
      Please get a hold of this tonight.  The Lord is so insistent that we get this and hang onto it, that we know that we have Life in us.  It is working in us.  And this Life will 
      change us from mortal to immortal.  That's the Life that is already here.  We don't have to look for something greater to come.  He is already here doing the work.  Amen, 
      don't look for some great explosion.  All that you are going to get is right in here with more revelation: more revelation and more faith to believe.  It is already here.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">We have everything we need.  We are fully equipped right now.  Right now, we are fully equipped.  That is what the Word says.  Don't look for something 
      else.  You have it.  You have Christ himself, Life.<strong class="w3-text-red">  “I am the way the truth and the life.”</strong> Didn't he say it?</p> 
      
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.10</p>  
    

    <p class="w3-justify">All right now…when we understand this scripture that the first birth he is speaking of is the forgiveness of sin when you first can see the kingdom, but 
      without the second birth – which is the birth of the Spirit – you can't enter into the kingdom.  But there is condemnation on the flesh still, because they are still under 
      that curse, because they haven't been brought to the knowledge of that.  God chooses who he wants to choose.  Don't you feel quite fortunate that you are called?</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">You see I could still be back in the Nazarene Church, bless their hearts.  And they will go the way of the grave, except they receive the baptism of the 
      Holy Ghost and except God call, but maybe it isn't for them.  Now they all could be, just like all could be saved. And the fact of him speaking to you (Gene) before, that you 
      were going to find that little place, that little church out in the country, you know that is God.  As sure as you are sitting there, you know that it is God because it has 
      come to pass.  And as sure as you are sitting there, I know you can't die.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify w3-xxlarge">The Sons Are Quickened In The Flesh</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Romans 8:11</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in 
      you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</strong> You see there, exactly what we are trying to 
      say.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken 
      your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</strong> You see, and Christ and the Father are one, remember?  And the Spirit, the Holy Ghost, they are all one.  
      Amen.  Quicken, give you life in your mortal bodies.  Quicken means Life.  He is already in here.  We are waiting, and we don't have to wait for him to come.  He is already 
      here.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.11</p>  

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Romans 5:9</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Much more then, being now justified by his blood,</strong> 
      Salvation.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> we shall be saved from wrath through him.</strong> But we have to have that, then he goes on, by the Spirit, and it goes on, 
      'wherefore by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed onto all men' and all of this and that.  But then it goes on, by the Spirit you'll have 
      Life.  But we won't get into that right now, because I have too much.  I want to just give what I feel.</p>

      Son.  Isn't it beautiful? To think that it is God's Word that we are reading, it is not something we are making up.  This is the Word of God, amen, and we have to know where 
      we stand.  We have to know that we have Life now.  We don't have to look for Life.  We have Life.  We have Life.  We have Life.  Amen.  We have had our dimmers on.  Now he has 
      taken the blinders off.  Amen.  They are looking for death, the by and by. The whole Christian world is looking for death when it is life. The book is so full of it, it just 
      almost scares me to think how stupid I was.  It is a wonder it didn't destroy me, yet it wasn't time for me – to be revealed.  Now is the time.  And the kingdom of God is not 
      death.  It is Life. </p>
