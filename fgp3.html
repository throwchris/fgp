    <p class="w3-justify w3-xlarge">This is so neat.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Acts 1:2-5</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Until the day</strong> Talking of Jesus
    <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</strong> 
    This was Jesus walking in the earth after he came back and was raised from the dead and came back in his glorified body.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> To whom also he 
    shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</strong> This is 
    where I got that scripture.  That is what he did.  He taught his disciples.  It doesn't say exactly what he taught, but it says that this is what he was instructing them in for 
    forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.  They knew some things and then they put it into words in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, as near as they 
    could, but it is the mysteries of God.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, 
    but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.</strong> He said I told you about this promise.  Here are the two births.
    <strong class="w3-text-red"> For John truly baptized with water;</strong> There is the first birth.<strong class="w3-text-red"> but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not 
    many days hence.</strong> That is the second birth, when the Holy Ghost came.That is the second birth.  The first birth, remember, he said you couldn't see the kingdom.  The 
    next birth he said you can't enter into the kingdom except you have this.  There is no way to enter into the kingdom except by the Holy Ghost. To be born of the Spirit is just 
    the beginning or opening of our understanding to the kingdom of Life.  Do you hear that?  When we receive the Holy Ghost, that was the beginning, or opening, of our 
    understanding to the kingdom of Life.  This is when we have passed from death unto life, the flesh to the spirit.  We do have Life, eternal Life through the Holy Ghost, 
    according to all the Scriptures; and believe me I searched before I teach a message like this.  And I picked out what I thought was to be taught.</p>
    

    <p class="w3-justify">(I think we need to rebuke Satan again because he is working through the children.  Now we haven't had that.  We haven't had that.  Amen.  It has been a 
        bedlam.  It hasn't bothered me one speck, but I know that Satan does not want this.  I rebuke you, Satan, in Jesus' name.  Now you leave the children alone.  Amen, in Jesus' 
        name.  Amen.  And open our ears to hear, and our spirits.) Well, things are quieting down.  Praise the Lord.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.14</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">2 Timothy 1:9-10</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling,</strong>
        This is the highest call you can get.  The thing that is the dearest to the heart of the Lord.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> not according to our works, but according 
        to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</strong> Remember what I said the Lord showed me?  Before the world was ever formed, 
        we were with him.  We were all one spirit and the Lord is drawing us back into one spirit again, with the Father, that we might become one again in the Father as we were 
        before the beginning, the Bible says.  But I couldn't quite understand that until he showed me this, what was happening here.  Before the world began.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But is now made manifest</strong> It is now made known.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, 
        who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</strong> Now how can you get away from that?  Now we are going to read it 
        again.  Isn't this neat?</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">2 Timothy 1:9-10</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not 
        according to our works,</strong> Not according to what we were before.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> but according to his own purpose</strong> He called 
        us.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, But is now made manifest</strong> Or made known.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ,</strong> When he came.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> who hath abolished death, and 
        hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</strong> You can't deny it.  We would be absolutely ridiculous not to accept Life when it is that plain.  
        Do you see it, everybody?  If not, we are going to keep hammering on it.  Do you understand it?  If you don't, put your hand up.  If you don't see the revelation.  If it is 
        not given to you by the Spirit, you won't see it.  Amen.  But I know, I tell you, I see the lights on some of your faces.  I know you have caught it.</p>    
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Now we know what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is for.  Remember when I used to say we really don't know what the Holy Ghost is for.  I used to say that, 
        and I wanted the Lord to show me, what was it really, there's more to it then what we knew.  Now this is it: he brought Life.  Now we can say with asurity, we have Life.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.15</p>    


    <p class="w3-justify w3-xlarge">We have that Life.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">This mortal, here's mortal.  Oh, that this mortal, Paul said, might be clothed upon with immortality.  That is what he was looking for.  He didn't say that 
        he might change my spirit, that he might die and come back, but oh, that this mortal, this flesh, might be clothed upon with immortality.  Because Paul saw it.  God had 
        given him that revelation.  How simple.  Are you thankful for what God has done?  He said he couldn't come in until we come in.  Amen.  He has waited awhile, hasn't he? You 
        know, I almost didn't teach this message.  How important it is that we really know what is going on.  Amen. At least we know now that we have Life within ourselves, now, 
        working in us.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Hebrews 2:14-15</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he 
        also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death,</strong> Now, you see, there is still just the same world 
        and all, even the Pentecostal people, Holy Ghost-filled people, are still accepting death when they don't have to, because they have never been taught.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</strong> Now, is he talking 
        about living forever?  He most certainly is.  They are in bondage because they fear death.  Who wants to die when God wants you to live?  What good are you dead?  No 
        good.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same;</strong> That is 
        what he came for.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death,</strong> Satan.  He took that away from him.  He 
        went down and he took the keys of death, hell and the grave.  You don't have to go to the grave because he took the keys of death, hell and the grave.  We don't have to go 
        to hell.  We don't have to die and be put in the grave.  And that is what he took.  That's what it is for.  Now if he has done the work, let's take it.  That is what he 
        said, didn't he? Now he is raising up another Son, amen.  Us.  Another Son, amen.  And he is not going to die, because this Son can't die: because Life lives in every one of 
        us.  And if we will receive it, and get a hold of it, and walk in it, and stay obedient: that is all it takes.  We can't bring it.  He has to do the work, if we will let him 
        do it.</p> 
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.16</p>    


    <p class="w3-justify">Now don't go out there and try to make yourself something you are not.  Okay?  Just be what you are.  It is his job.  We hinder him sometimes, when we try 
        to make ourselves righteous.  We try to please God.  You don't have to try to please him, you already please him.  That is why he chose you.  Well, isn't it the truth?  It 
        is ridiculous. It sounds so ridiculous when you see the scriptures say he took the keys of death, hell and the grave.  You know.  But, you see, that is a fact.  That is the 
        way that he had to die; and then to be put in the grave; and then he overcome the grave by the resurrection out of the grave.  Amen.  So you can see where the Lord could 
        have changed him right then on the cross, but he had to overcome all of that death, hell and the grave.  And he went into hell for us.  And so he took the keys of all three 
        and said he gave them to the church, but the church hasn't accepted them, but we take them in the name of the Lord.  Amen.  Because in the Scriptures we know it.  We don't 
        say that boastfully, we just know it. Well, we all know this.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">1 Corinthians 15:20-26</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the 
        firstfruits of them that slept.</strong> So that they could come out also.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For since by man came death,</strong> Through 
        Adam.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</strong> Which is great, too.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For as in Adam all 
        die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</strong> Now we know there is a resurrection for those that have died, that have gone on, that couldn't come into this order; 
        and thank God for it.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.</strong> At 
        the day of resurrection.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Then cometh the end,</strong> Now this is where the key is.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Then cometh the 
        end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath 
        put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</strong> Now the thing is, we already have Life because the Scripture says so, but all death 
        will be done away with, not just the Christian death, all death will be done away with.  That is the final. We have Life now.  We do not have death.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.17</p>    
  

    <p class="w3-justify w3-xlarge">We have Life now.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">But all death, and he put that word in there, all death.  The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.  And he has to put all things under his feet.  
        So we know that by the Scriptures, he has several things he is speaking of here: the unsaved, the saved that will come forth in the resurrection, the unsaved that will come 
        forth in the resurrection, and all of these things when he has to finally destroy; all of that.  And the scripture that we were talking about yesterday when they will say 
        that they will seek death and won't find it, because there will be such terrible suffering in their physical, but death will be destroyed.  A man, if he had had only a piece 
        of that hand, if that's all that was left, it would still be alive.  Because they will seek death and cannot find it.  So we know that death is a reality.  Amen. Now this is 
        accepting or asking for death.  That is the easy way.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Numbers 14:2</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against 
        Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!</strong> What a sad story.  
        And here was Christ in the wilderness with them, Life itself, and they complained after the way God had treated them.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Numbers 14:20-24</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy 
        word:</strong> They made some commitments.  When we make commitments, God takes us at our own word and he still does.  It is what we say, that by the words of our mouths we 
        stand or fall.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.</strong> In spite of them, all the earth 
        will be filled with the glory of the Lord.  Now that is a promise for us.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, 
        which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; Surely they shall not see the land which I sware

        for us.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:</strong> Just according to our own words. 
        Isn't that something?  This is why it is important that we speak faith.  Isn't it?  It is according to our own words.  He said you are carcases.  He said I am doing it 
        according as you have spoken it.  As spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you.  They said, "Why didn't we die in the wilderness?  Why didn't you just let us die?"
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and 
        upward, which have murmured against me, Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and 
        Joshua the son of Nun. But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey,</strong> You said all the little ones were going to starve out here in the wilderness and be a 
        prey of the beasts.  Out of your own mouth, see?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they 
        shall know the land which ye have despised.</strong> That reminded me – it tickles me so because of my own people, some of them said, "Well, Rose will never have a church."  
        They heard the word that God was going to give me a church and all of that, years ago.  "She's too old, but maybe it will be Carol or one of her children, but she'll 
        never – it will never be fulfilled."  It just makes me laugh because it is the same sort of thing here.  You see they are looking after the flesh and not after what God – God 
        is God.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.</strong> Or rejected.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear 
        your whoredoms,</strong> They have to put up with all of that.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. After the number of the 
        days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year,</strong> Isn't God exact?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> shall ye bear your iniquities, even 
        forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. I the Lord have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in 
        this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</strong> There's the curse of death.  They could have had life.  I believe if Enoch received life and if 
        Elijah had life, had they believed…  Life was taught way back in – all through the Scriptures.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.19</p>    
  

    <p class="w3-justify">These scriptures aren't quite as exciting, but we have to know how to get into it, too.  And the Lord gave me this as a kind of a warning to us to be 
        careful. In the pastor's house where I got the prophecy about the Church, this man became sick not too long after that.  He used to pray for a lot of people and he had a 
        great healing ministry.  And people would go to him and come to him from all over.  And he had great power with God and great anointing to pray for the sick.  And many, many
        miracles had taken place.  But he himself got sick.  And he got frustrated because he thought that he shouldn't get sick.  And so he wouldn't pray for anybody while he was 
        sick.  Now, he didn't have a sickness that would have killed him.  The doctors say they don't know why he died, but I knew why he died and his wife knew why he died, and she 
        called me and told me why he died.  She is still alive.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">He said one night, “If you don't raise me up out of this bed,” and she heard him, “if God don't raise me up out of this bed, then take me.”  He was ashamed 
        because God would put something on him.  He thought he was so, I suppose, high-minded.  Just because God wouldn't heal him in his time, and he was taking him through 
        something trying to burn out of him – like all of us.  You know, all of us have to go through these things, trying to burn out of the man what was in him, that pride – that 
        very thing that was in him.  And so God took him at his word.  He died the next day, for no apparent reason.  And she cried so.  She said, "Marvin didn't have to die, Rose. 
        He didn't have to die."</p>
    
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.20</p>    
  

    <p class="w3-justify">But God took him up on the words of his own mouth.  He said, "Either you heal me or take me."  He commanded God.  And God just took him.  Now that is the 
        honest fact.  She will tell you that today.  He did not have to die.  But you don't say, "God, you either heal me or you take me."  God is the boss.  Amen.  You don't 
        challenge God.  That is a good warning for all of us.  Don't challenge God.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">God is so honest, and he never covers anything up.  He tells about the good guys and the bad guys.  And it doesn't make any difference, does it?  That is 
        the way it ought to be.  That is the way we are becoming more like Christ, because we are opening things up.  If you do something, don't run away and hide.  Satan has got 
        you cornered then. It is better to get it out.  Right out in the open.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">I could have said, “Well, I won't teach on that about the birth, because I taught it different awhile ago – that it had to be the natural birth and then 
        the birth of the Spirit.  But you see, I want truth.  And he would have taken that revelation away from me, do you know that, if I would have let pride or something come in. 
        This is why if I make a mistake, I have to come right out, don't I, and say it. I was doing the best I could do.  God knew that. He hadn't revealed this to me: what he was 
        talking about, being saved and then the birth of the Spirit, Amen, of Life in us.  So we have to be honest.  That is the way we learn.</p>
